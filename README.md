<h2 align="center">Skills</h2>

### **Python**   
*Jupyter Notebook, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tweepy, Selenium, BeautifulSoup*   
From data collection, through Web Scraping, using packages like Selenium and Beautiful Soup, or not. Intimacy with data cleaning and data analysis with pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn; feature engineering and Machine learning with scikit-learn.

### **R**   
*RStudio, tidyverse (ggplot2, tidyr, stringr, dplyr, etc.)*   
Intimate with tidyverse for data analysis. See more [here](https://github.com/KenzoBH/Data-Science/blob/main/ENEM_Python/ENEM_by_school_EDA_Python.ipynb), link that you can find a data analysis made in R.

### **Web**
